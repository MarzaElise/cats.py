## FAQ

1. Are all endpoints supported?

   - All of the endpoints except for images/upload works perfectly as I tested them locally before publishing
   - All `breeds/` endpoints might break since the API is constantly adding new properties

2. Why is `utils/_dataclasses.py` such a code-gore?

   - Data returned by the API is inconsistent. For example, some properties are sometimes given and
    sometimes not. To manage that I set them all to None by default

3. How is this wrapper object oriented?

   - All values returned by each method has its own class (Breed, Vote, Favourite etc)
   - This entire wrapper revolves around dataclasses and subclassing

4. I found a bug, how do I report?

   - You can contact me on discord at [Marcus | Bot Dev#4438](https://discord.com/users/754557382708822137)
   - If you are not on discord, open a new [issue](https://github.com/MarzaElise/cats.py/issues)
   - If you also have a fix for it, create a new pull request and I'll merge it if its good. (See [Contributing](#contributing))

5. Will there be an aync version of this?

   - I currently have no plans to do it in the near future. If you really want an asynchronous wrapper,
   take a look at [catapi.py](https://github.com/ephreal/catapi.py)

6. Is this wrapper consistent?

   - I tried my best to keep this wrapper consistent with the API itself. By returning lists when API
     returns an array etc.

7. Where is the documentation?

   - Currently, there is no documentation for this wrapper. Alternatively, you can take a look at the
     [API documentation](https://docs.thecatapi.com) and the source to figure out some stuff.

Note: all changes were tested on python 3.10.0 64-bit before being published
